\section{Introduction}
The Data Intensive Science has become an indispensable aspect of the peo-
ple's lives. We use it in many different areas to gain knowledge by analysis
of integrated data. The overall goal of that assignment is to extract infor-
mation from that data set and transform it into an understandable structure
for further use. This exercise is about detailed analysis of classification algorithm by using a tool weka.
Nowadays the databases are of huge size,so it is difficult to analize those data,tools like weka are 
devolped. Classification is a data mining (machine learning) technique used 
to predict group membership for data instances. 

We had to pick three datasets from UCI Machine Learning Repository, which should have different characteristics. 
Our choice was:
\begin{enumerate}
    \item "Census-Income (KDD) Data Set" \\ 
(http://http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Census-Income+%28KDD%29)
    \item "Connect-4 Data Set " \\
        (http://http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Connect-4)
    \item "Echocardiogram  Data Set" \\
        (http://http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Echocardiogram)
\end{enumerate}

We have used 5 different classifier algorithm by the tool \emph{Weka}. 
These techniques were;
\begin{enumerate}
    \item Naive Bayes
    \item Decision Tree
    \item Random Forest
    \item Nearest Neighbor
    \item Support Vector Machine
\end{enumerate}

\section{Overview of the data sets}
\subsection{Census-Income data set}
The census income data set contains almost three hundred instances in two files
and is the largest dataset among those three sets. The dataset has forthy
dimensions, whereby some of the fields contain nominal data. There are two
seperate files, one is for testing (1/3 of the data) and one is for training (2/3
of the data). We have unified these two files in one. The data set contain
missing values. We decided to use this dataset to test the performance of the
methods. This dataset contains 1 class labels, yearly income. The income have
been binned at the 50000\$ level to present binary classification. The goal field
of this data, however, was drawn from the "total person income" field rather
than the "adjusted gross income" and may, therefore, behave differently than the
orginal ADULT goal field.

\subsection{Connect-4 data set}
The connect-4 data set is the large dataset, has more than 67000 instances.
Every instance has 42 fields, which contain just categorical data. Some of those
map to numeric intervals
(area of the spots). The set lacks missing values, therefore it is well suited
to test various methods to handle categorical data, with the 1-N coding. The
database has 3 class labels, and a class labels which
is the result of the connect-4 game, i.e. win or loss or draw.

\subsection{Ecocardiogram data set}
The last and the smallest dataset is the echocardiogram data set. The
echocardiogram has just 132 instances and also the same number of missing
values. Given the high percentage of
missing values, this dataset is suited to test different methods to handle those
missing values. The twelve attributes contain mainly numeric values. The second
field and the last field can be the class value. All the patients suffered heart
attacks at some point in the past. The second field is whether the patient still
alive or not. The survival and still-alive variables, when taken together,
indicate whether a patient survived for at least one year following the heart
attack (the last attribute). 

\section{Methods tried}


\section{Experiments and results for the individual datasets}

\subsection{Census-Income (KDD) data set}

\subsection{Connect-4 data set}

Connect-4 is a two player game and normally the players choose a color disk, but in our dataset, first player uses 'x' which is called player x and second player, i.e. player o uses 'o'. Then the players start to drop their pieces into a seven column and six row vertically suspended grid. The disks fall straight down, occupying the next available space within column. The goal of the game is to connect four of one's own discs of the same letter next to each other vertically, horizontally, or diagonally before your opponent. ($http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Connect_Four$) 

The game has played 8 turns and none of the player has won yet. The attributes are all of the square in the seven column and six row board, which can be $\{$x, o, b$\}$ i.e. x is for the player x, o is for player o and b for blank. So, the dataset includes 42 attributes for the board grid. The data set has not got any missing values. Every instances has 4 times x, 4 times o values and the rest are b. 

We have chosen this data set due to test preprocess for 1-N coding. The function for one code encoding in weka is NominalToBinary. And after we have run that function all of these columns changed to the columnname=x, columnname=o, columnname=b, one of it will be 1 and the others will be 0, depends on a value of the columnname. After the preprocess there are 127 attributes with the class label. 

The class variable can be win or loss or draw. The distribution of it is; 44473 records win, i.e. 65.83 $\%$, 16635 records loss,  i.e. 24.62 $\%$ and 6449 records draw,  i.e. 9.55 $\%$.
